---- Changes since 1.81 ----
A Sendmail genericstable or Postfix canonical mapping file can be automatically updated with login name to email address mappings. This is useful for programs like Usermin, which can read such a file to work out From: addresses.
The directory for Webalizer statistics can be set on the Apache Website Template page.
Domain owners can be granted access to the Read User Mail module, for reading mailboxe's mail.
The port to use for normal and SSL virtual websites can now be set on the Apache Website Template page.
Virtual servers can now be backed up to one or many tar.gz files, either locally or on a remote FTP server.
Backups can also be restored from these tar.gz files, again locally or from an FTP server.
The MySQL feature now properly supports usernames longer that 16 characters.
A new configuration option has been added for sites that use multiple IP addresses, but always use name-based Apache virtual hosts.
Username length and other restrictions are now checked by the create-domain.pl script.
Virtualmin now participates in Webmin action logging, so you can see what actions were taken and which files they changed.
IP address clash checking for new servers now actually works.
Webalizer configuration files and schedule can now be included in backups.
---- Changes since 1.91 ----
Catchall mail aliases can now forward mail for any mailbox at their domain to the same mailbox at another domain.
Added module configuration options to prevent domain owners from being given access to feature-related modules like Apache Webserver, BIND DNS Server and so on.
Added checks to prevent an alias or mailbox being created which clashes with an existing Sendmail or Postfix alias.
Added a Module Config option to set the subdirectory used for mailbox user home directories, instead of always using ~/homes.
Added Module Config option to specify an different IP address to use in the DNS domain, versus the one used for the webserver.
Added the ability to backup and restore to via SSH, as well as FTP.
Added a new feature for Virtualmin domains - virtual FTP hosting with ProFTPd. Like Apache virtual hosts, these will be created when the feature is enabled for domain, using directives taken from an editable template. Due to limitations in the FTP protocol, a domain can only have a virtual FTP server if it has its own private IP.
---- Changes since 2.00 ----
Added an option to the BIND DNS Template page for selecting a view to add new zones to.
Added automatic IP address allocation for virtual servers, out of ranges defined on the Module Config page.
A Virtualmin server owner can now create and own multiple domains, if allowed by the master administrator. All such servers are owned by the same Unix user and share the same quota, and any sub-servers are stored in the domains subdirectory of the parent server's home directory. Each server can have its own independent set of features. When a limit on the number of mailboxes has been set, it will apply to the master server and all sub-servers.
Added an option to the Apache Website Template page for entering an Apache user to be added to the group for all new servers. This can be useful for getting suexec to work.
Added Module Config options to have features disabled by default for new servers.
Added Manage SSL Certificate page for creating a CSR and installing a signed SSL certificate using simple forms.
Added Change Domain Name page for modifying the name of an existing virtual server. This can also update the server's Unix login and home directory at the same time, if needed. All sub-servers of the modified server are also updated, where appropriate.
When restoring a virtual server, if it no longer exists it will be automatically re-created with all the original features before the restore is done.
---- Changes since 2.10 ----
Aliases for an existing virtual server can now be created. An alias is a server that simply forwards all web, mail and DNS requests to another server. Alias websites can be created as a virtual server that simply redirects requests or by adding additional ServerAlias directives to the target website.
Added a new Bandwidth Monitoring page for setting up regular checking of virtual server web bandwidth usage, and inputs on the server creation and editing forms to specify the amount of bandwidth each can use. When the limit is exceeded, a configurable email is sent to the domain owner and other optional addresses. The monitoring page also displays usage and limits by all servers as a bar graph.
Added a new feature - the ability to setup Logrotate to automatically truncate and compress a virtual server's log files, so that they don't consume too much disk space.
The subject lines for emails sent when a new virtual server, sub-server and mailbox are created can now be edited, and can include template variables.
Email messages send when a virtual server or mailbox is created can now be also Cc'd to additional configurable addresses.
Added the ability to use new functions in the BIND module to speed up the process of creating slave zones on a remote DNS server.
Added a new format for mailbox usernames - mailbox@domain, the same as the email address. This only works when using Sendmail as the mail server though.
The Qmail mail server is now fully supported, with all the same capabilities as Postfix and Sendmail. Only a stock install of Qmail is required by Virtualmin - vpopmail or other similar patches are not needed.
When a mailbox is created, its empty mail file or directory is automatically created, in a location determined by the configuration of the mail server in use.
A virtual server can now be created without a Unix user, as long as it only has a DNS domain or MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. For other features, the Unix user is required.
Added an additional way to proxy a virtual server to another URL - frame forwarding.
Added the ability to easily edit the forwarding destination for proxy-only or frame forwarding websites, along with the forwarding frame page title or HTML.
Moved all template-related settings into the 'Server Templates' section, including directives for Apache websites, FTP virtual servers and DNS domains. Multiple templates can now be defined, and a template can be selected when creating a virtual server.
The home directory for a virtual server can now be enabled separate from its Unix user.
On systems like FreeBSD in which the username length is limited, the prefix for mailbox usernames is now selectable when creating a server.
Added an option to automatically disable a server when it reaches its bandwidth limit.
Added an option to send an email message when a server is approaching (within some percentage) its bandwidth limit.
Added support for third-party plugin feature modules.
Added support for mailbox user plugins, which can add additional inputs and capabilities to a mail user.
Added a restore.pl script to restore domains and features from the command line.
Fixed a bug when attempting to rename a PostgreSQL user on older versions that don't allow it.
Added a Module Config option for a jailed FTP shell.
---- Changes since 2.30 ----
Fixed several bugs related to creating and restoring backups.
Moved bandwidth graphs to separate page, and added mode to show sub-domain usage.
Added the command-line backup-domain.pl script.
Added button to domain editing page for viewing latest Webalizer report.
Implemented support for using LDAP to store domain and mailbox users and groups, by calling functions in Webmin's LDAP user management module. Requires that the system be set up to use LDAP for NSS and PAM.
Clash checking is now done when enabling new features for an existing server.
When creating a server, if a feature fails for some reason the rest will still be processed. This avoids the problem of a server being partially created and unknown to Virtualmin.
Similarly, when deleting a server any failure will be ignored, to avoid the problem of features being left around when the server has been removed from Virtualmin.
A database name can be specified when creating a server, rather than the default which is computed from the domain name.
Added form on plugins page for editing the configuration of plugins that have a config.info file.
Added the enable-feature.pl and disable-feature.pl script, for activating and turning off features for a virtual server from the command line.
Added the enable-limit.pl and disable-limit.pl scripts, for updating server owner limits from the command line.
Created the Custom Fields page, for defining your own fields that can be edited for each virtual server.
Added a button to the Edit Server page for displaying just the usage for that server. This is available to server owners as well as the master administrator.
Added a new limit for domain owners to prevent them from choosing the name for new domain databases.
---- Changes since 2.40 ----
Fixed bug related to multiple IF- blocks for the same variable in templates.
Added support for Qmail+LDAP as a new mail system. If selected, all mail users and aliases will be stored in LDAP automatically. Thanks to Omar Amas for sponsoring this feature.
Added extra domain owner limits to force sub-domains to be under parent domains, and to prevent renaming.
Added support for Qmail+VPOPMail as a new mail system. When enabled, all mailboxes and aliases are created in VPOPMail instead of using Unix users. Thanks to Linulex for sponsoring this one.
When editing the forwarding destinations for email to a user, the user's mailbox can be explicitly selected as a destination.
On the server template page, default aliases for new users in domains using that template can be specified.
Added an option to exclude the logs directory from backups.
The default MySQL database name, wildcard and allowed hosts can now be set on the server templates page.
A virtual server can now have more than one MySQL or PostgreSQL database, which can be managed using the Edit Databases button on the Edit Server page. Thanks to Olimont for sponsoring this feature, and the backup changes.
The create-domain.pl script can now create sub-servers and alias servers too.
Added a Module Config option to have domain and mailbox users created in other modules.
Added options on the restore page to fix up the DNS and Apache IP addresses when restoring. Useful when transferring a domain from another server.
---- Changes since 2.50 ----
When using VPOPMail as the mail server and a domain uses an existing Unix group, no extra group for mailboxes is created.
Default quotas and other limits for a new domain can now be specified in templates, instead of globally.
Added support for the VPOPMail autoresponder program.
FTP server logs can now be used for bandwidth accounting as well, so that anonymous downloads and files downloaded by domain owners count towards bandwidth usage totals. Thanks to Olimont.com for sponsoring this feature, and the mail log support.
Mail server logs (in Sendmail, Postfix or Qmail formats) can now be checked to include mail sent to mailboxes and aliases in a domain in bandwidth totals.
Usage graphs now show bandwidth used by each feature in a different colour, and can show usage by day or month as well as by domain.
Creation of an initial MySQL or PostgreSQL database for a server is now optional. Instead, you can choose to just have a login created instead.
Add file writes now use the new Webmin API to prevent truncation if a disk space shortage or other error occurs.
Added an option to the domain creation form to generate a password randomly.
Domain names and usernames can now start with a number.
The permissions on the public_html directory can now be edited on the server template page.
Added an option on the template page for doing web logging via a program, which silently ignores problems writing to the logs. This prevents Apache from failing to re-start if a user deletes his ~/logs directory.
The Webalizer statistics directory can now be password protected, via an option on the Server Templates page.
Added an option to the Bandwidth Monitoring page to disable it for selected servers, such as those that have extremely large logs.
When Webmin 1.201 or later is installed, there is an additional option on the Server Templates page to have Webmin and Usermin per-IP SSL certificates added to match those used for the Apache SSL virtual server.
Made available an option on the template page for turning off the automatic synchronization between a server's password and that of its MySQL login.
Added an option on the template page for defining default mail aliases for new servers.
---- Changes since 2.60 ----
Added a button to the Edit Server page for re-sending the signup email.

Slave zones can now be added to multiple servers, when using Webmin version 1.203 or later.
When a server's home directory is renamed, any protected web directories within it will be properly updated too.
Added command-line programs called enable-writelogs.pl and disable-writelogs.pl to turning on or off logging via a program for existing domains, or all domains.
Quotas and bandwidth limits on the templates page now have proper units like kB or MB, rather than being in bytes.
Added support for resellers, which are users who can create top-level virtual servers up to limits imposed by the master administrator. Each reseller can be limited in the number of servers, mailboxes and databases he can own, and the total quota he can assign to all owned servers.
Added support for third-party script installation, such as PHP-Nuke, Formmail and other common web tools. These can be installed and managed using the Install Scripts button on the Edit Server page.
Created a new feature - per-domain Spam filtering using SpamAssassin and Procmail. Each server can have its own SpamAssassin settings and spam delivery action.
Added a similar feature for per-domain Virus filtering using ClamAV.
Added an icon on the main page and a button on the Edit Server page for emailing all server owners and all mailboxes in a domain respectively.
Ranges for automatic IP allocation can now be defined in a more user-friendly way on the Server Templates page.
Added built-in support for granting mail/FTP users access to MySQL databases.
Templates can now be restricted to some, all or no resellers.
All quota fields now have an option for selecting the units, rather than always being entered in kB.
Added a new option on the Edit Owner Limits page, to put a server into demo mode. In this mode, the owner cannot make changes to any settings, only view them.

Virtual servers without mail enabled can now create and manage users, for database and FTP access purposes.
Server owners can backup their own virtual servers, but only to a remote FTP or SSH server.

Added command-line programs for deleting virtual servers and users, and disabling and enabling servers.
Added the modify-domain.pl command-line program, for changing various attributes of a virtual server.
Added a system information display to the main page, showing the versions of the various programs that Virtualmin uses.
A virtual server with a private IP address can now have it removed on the Edit Server page (assuming that it doesn't have an SSL website or virtual FTP server).
Added help pages for the template, reseller, IP allocation, plugin and custom fields pages.
Added command-line programs for listing, creating and deleting mail aliases.
Added command-line programs for listing and modifying users.
Database names can now be restricted to start with the server's domain name, using a new option on the server template page.

Added command-line programs for listing and setting custom fields.
Added the migrate-domain.pl command-line program for importing a backup from another control panel, such as Plesk.
Added a Module Config option to add an /etc/procmailrc entry to force delivery to the default destination, to prevent mailbox users from running commands via .procmailrc files.
On Sendmail systems, you can specify the bounce message for aliases whose destination is set to Bounce mail.
The Change IP Address page can now also be used to set a different port for a server's normal and SSL websites. This can be useful for running an SSL server on a non-standard port, without needing a private IP.
The template for an existing virtual server can now be changed. However, this does not immediately effect any of its settings.
Space used by databases is now included in the disk quota displays, although it is not actually enforced.
---- Changes since 2.80 ----
Proxying and frame forwarding can be enabled, disabled and configured more easily for existing web virtual servers using the Edit Proxy Website and Edit Forwarding Frame buttons on the Edit Server page.
The import feature now supports SSL Apache virtual servers too.

Virtual server mail/FTP/database users can also be assigned to arbitrary secondary groups, defined on the Server Templates page.
---- Changes since 2.85 ----
Network interfaces are now identified by address rather than name, to avoid problems with interface numbers changing on operating systems like Gentoo and FreeBSD.
Added a new backup format that doesn't create files in /tmp when not needed, instead using only each server's home directory.
---- Changes since 2.87 ----
Added help on the Backup Virtual Servers page.
Fixed some messages and small bugs reported by users.
---- Changes since 2.88 ----

---- Changes since 2.89 ----
When importing a virtual server, a parent server can be specified to control the new domain in Virtualmin.
Added a button below the user list, which brings up a page for defining defaults for new users in that virtual server. This can be used to define initial quotas, FTP access, databases and mail forwarding.
---- Changes since 2.90 ----
When disabling a virtual server, the accounts for any mail users are locked too.
The 'Home directory' and 'Unix users' are now always enabled, unless you select to make them optional on the Module Config page. These are needed for almost all virtual servers, so it makes little sense to show the option.
Added a button for re-checking the licence immediately if a problem was detected during a regularly scheduled check.
Mail users can have their logins temporarily enabled or disabled, using the web or command-line interfaces.
Limits can now be placed on the number of aliases a virtual server can have, at the server owner and reseller levels. In addition, plugins can specify that certain aliases should not count towards this limit (or be displayed to the user).
The method by which the domain name is appended or prepended to a mail user's name can now be set on a per-template basis.
Plugins can now define their own limits to be configured on the Edit Owner Limits form, such as a restriction on the number of mailing lists a server can have.
Added support for plugins that define new database types.
---- Changes since 2.92 ----
Added an option to email a mailbox user with his new account details upon saving, and a template page for editing the message sent.
Added a form to the Script Installers page for upgrading some script on several virtual servers at once.
Extra Webmin modules can be specified for server owners on the Edit Owner Limits page.
Virtual server functions that a server own can access (like databases, scripts, users and aliases) can now be individually controlled on the Edit Owner Limits page, rather than being automatically determined based on his ability to create servers.
Resellers can now have their own IP allocation ranges defined, which will apply to all virtual servers that they create or manage.
Added a template option to have an alias server under another domain when a server is created. This can be useful when a new domain has not yet been registered, to allow it to be accessed under the provider's domain.
When restoring a single virtual server, you can select to restore just one mail/FTP user instead of all of them. You can also choose to just re-import a server whose /etc/webmin/virtual-server/domains file is missing.
Added a new type of mail/FTP user who can manage the virtual server's website files. This user has the same permissions as the server owner, but is restricted to it's web files directory.
---- Changes since 2.94 ----
Feature selection when adding or editing a virtual server is now done using checkboxes rather than Yes/No radio buttons.
Added a section to the Server Template page for specifiying the logrotate directives for a new server, rather than always using Virtualmin's automatically generated directives.
Server owners can be prevented from editing the schedule and directory for their Webalizer reports, using a new option on the Server Template page.
Added a button for creating a sub-domain, which is like a sub-server but is always under the parent domain, and uses a sub-directory of its web files directory as the document root.
By default, settings that used to be on the Create Server page with are set in the template (such as the quota, bandwidth limit and mailbox/alias/database limits) are no longer displayed. Instead, the settings from the selected template are used. The old behaviour can be restored using a setting on the Module Config page.
---- Changes since 2.96 ----
The message displayed on the website of a disabled virtual server is now configurable on the server template page, rather than being fixed.
A new server template option allows disabled websites to redirect the browser to a different URL, rather than service a local HTML page.
When backing up virtual servers, you can also include core Virtualmin configuration settings, such as templates, resellers, the module configuration and so on. The restore page also has options to extract these from a backup. This new feature allows all data relevant to Virtualmin to be backed up from a single place.
---- Changes since 2.97 ----
Added buttons to the list of virtual servers for deleting several at once, and updating settings such as the quota, bandwidth limit and enabled features on several at once. The same form can be also used to disable or enable multiple virtual servers.
Extra PHP variables to be added to a server's Apache config when a third-party script is installed can be set on the Server Templates page.
Added a new configuration page available to the master administrator for specifying Webmin servers with Virtualmin installed to be used as secondary MX's. Once this is done, any new mail domains will be relayable through those servers.
---- Changes since 2.98 ----
The FTP server can be stopped and started, like the mail, DNS and web servers.
---- Changes since 2.99 ----
Multiple databases can be deleted at once from a virtual server.
Updated the modify-limits.pl command line program to allow setting of editing limits and maximum aliases.
When adding or removing Sendmail domains to accept email for, comments in the local domains file in /etc/mail are now preserved.
Plugins can now define additional inputs to display on the Server Template page, such as defaults for limits on the number of mailing lists, repositories and so on.
Extra administration logins can be created for virtual servers, who have a subset of the permissions granted to the main administrator. This allows server owners to delegate some of their powers to other people, without giving out the main password for the virtual server.
Limits can be set at the server owner and reseller levels on the number of alias and non-alias servers, which are imposed in addition to the overall limit on servers. This allows users to be given separate higher limits on alias servers.
Added command-line programs to list and manage extra administrators.
---- Changes since 3.00 ----
When renaming a domain that has users in user@domain format, the users will be renamed too.
---- Changes since 3.01 ----
Server owner limits can be updated for multiple users at once on the Update Virtual Servers page.
The email addreses to send status monitoring messages to can be set on the Server Templates page.
When restoring a backup, the home directory of any virtual servers created is re-allocated to use the directory and rules defined on the destination system.

---- Changes since 3.05 ----
Added PHP module checking to the Horde script installer, and updated it and other dependent scripts to the latest versions.
Added script installers for MediaWiki and TWiki.

Added a script installer for DokuWiki.
Fixed a bug that prevented additional database access for mail users from being properly restored.
The displayed mailbox size for users with Maildir format inboxes includes all sub-folders and other files within the directory.
The size of mailboxes is calculated from the number of blocks used rather than the byte file sizes, which is more accurate as it reflects the true quota usage.
Added a script installer for Moodle (thanks to Kevin Rauth).
Added a script installer for phpAdsNew.
Added command-line programs for listing, installing and removing third-party scripts.
Added online help for the Server Owner Limits page.
Added a work-around for the problem of mail being delivered with ownership root by the procmail wrapper.

Updated the installer to have Webmin pre-load several Virtualmin and Webmin libraries, speeding up the user interface.
Added a link to the left-side frame for viewing a domain's website, using a HTTP request tunnelled through Webmin. This is useful if the domain name has not been fully registered in the DNS yet.
The Command Shell module is now available to server owners - but can be disabled on the Module Config page.
Removed the Logrotate and Webalizer features for sub-domains, which share log files with the parent domain.

When moving a sub-server, you now have the option to convert it to a top-level server with a new username and password.
When email is enabled or disabled for an existing virtual server, MX records are added to or removed from the DNS domain.
Virtual server owners are no longer allowed to change the Apache server name or aliases for their websites, as this can confuse Virtualmin.
Changed the way ClamAV is called from Procmail so that it doesn't reject mail when some error occurs, such as a shortage of disk space for scanning.
Added checks for ownership to directory validation.
Added script installer for IntegraMOD.
When moving a server, if a vital feature fails (like the home directory or Unix user), the entire process is halted.

The virtual server validation function now checks to ensure that mail user home directories exist and have the correct ownerships.
New and modified mailbox messages can use blocks like $IF-VIRTUALMIN-DAV to display different messages depending on whether or not plugin features like DAV are enabled.
When importing a virtual server, users can be found by a regular expression as well as just matching by primary group.
Fixed a bug that could cause mailbox users' home directories to be owned by the server administrator.

Each reseller can have an IP address specified for virtual servers with shared address websites under his ownership to be set up on. All DNS records in the servers' domains will use that IP, which allows resellers to appear to have a dedicated server for their customer domains.
The change IP address page can now modify the IP of name-based servers, if more than one possibility is available (such as from a reseller IP). Similar, the modify-domain.pl program now takes a --shared-ip option to do the same thing.

Added the search-maillogs.pl command-line script, with the same functionality as the web-based mail search.

Updated the TWiki script install to redirect /twiki (or whatever path is selected) to /cgi-bin/twiki/view, which actually shows the Wiki. 
Added a section to the Spam and Virus Delivery page for changing the virus scanner to use for existing domains, for choosing between clamscan and clamdscan. Also made it easier to change the default for this on the Module Config page.
Updated the modify-spam.pl program to add the --use-clamscan and --use-clamdscan program.
When a virtual server with a website and private IP address is deleted, any Listen directives added for its IP are removed from the Apache configuration.
Added a Module Config option to change the default SSL key size, and increased the default to 1024 bits.

The PHP module mcrypt is now only recommended when installing phpMyAdmin, but not strictly required.
Added a button on the Install Scripts for upgrading several to the latest version at once.
When SSL is enabled for a virtual server, all Apache directives are copied from the non-SSL virtualhost section. This ensures that directives added by plugins or PHP configuration are preserved.
Added an option to the Edit Virtual Server page to turn off disabling when the bandwidth limit is reached, or a per-domain basis. Also added corresponding --bw-disable and --bw-no-disable options to the modify-domain.pl command-line script.
If the system has a bonded interface but no ethernet, it will be detected as the primary interface.
The display of mailbox sizes is now off by default.
The configuration check process now ensures that the system is setup to use itself as a DNS server, so that newly created domains will resolve.
Added a regular check for ophan php-cgi processes left around by Apache restarts on some systems, and kill any found.
Added an option to the scheduled backup page to only send an email report when the backup fails, and an option to send email to domain owners as well.
When a virtual server with anonymous FTP is created, the ProFTPd user (typically ftp) is added to the domain's Unix group. This allows anonymous FTP to work even when the domain's home directory is not world-readable.
Added checkboxes to the mail log search form to exclude spam and viruses from the results.
Added a search box to the list of scripts, to more easily find the one you want in the current huge list.

Added a Module Config setting for the number of days of processed mail logs to keep, implemented an index cache file to speed up searches, and created a Cron job to periodically update the logs.
Added a Cron job to periodically update per-domain SpamAssassin config files from the global configuration, so that configs added by a SpamAssassin upgrade are not missing from the per-domain directories.
---- Changes since 3.41 ----
Added a new template section for defining your own PHP wrapper scripts, for use when PHP is run via CGI or FastCGI.
When a virtual server with a private IP is added, ping is now used to check if the IP is already in use.
Updated the Flyspray script installer to version 0.9.9.2, and phpPgAdmin to 4.1.2.

Added additional warning when deleting scripts from ~/public_html.
Website validation now includes a check for PHP wrapper scripts.
Added a Module Config option to make the DNS client configuration check optional.
PHP modules are now automatically installed from CSW packages on Solaris.

Globally disabled features are no longer shown greyed-out on the virtual server creation and editing forms.
Under Apache 2.2, add NameVirtualHost *:80 instead of just *.
Virtual servers now have separate php.ini files for each PHP version (4 and 5), under ~/etc/php*. This allows different extensions to be loaded for each PHP version, and for different settings to exist.
Changed the layout of the Plugin Modules page to make it easier to see what is selected, and added a checkbox to have plugins available but not active by default.
Logins and passwords for using installed scripts are now recorded.
The Manage Script page now shows more information about an installed scripts, such as the install directory, database and possibly login and password. The list-scripts.pl command also displays the same information.

Updated the phpMyAdmin script installer to version 2.10.2, WordPress to 2.2.1, SMF to 1.1.3, DokuWiki to 2007-06-26, and Gallery to 2.2.2.
Added an option to the DNS section of server templates for specifying the hostname to use in the primary NS record for new DNS domains, rather than the system's hostname.
Added script installers for phpScheduleIt, PHP-Calendar and Plans, and created a new script category for calendars.

Added a page for creating multiple email aliases at once from a batch file, linked from the Mail Aliases list.
Updated the Batch Create Servers page to allow alias domains to be created, by specifying an extra field for the alias domain name.
Password changes to mail / FTP users from the Users and Groups modules now correctly update all the various passwords maintained by Virtualmin, such as MySQL and SVN - if the option to update in other modules is checked.
Added a script installer for Ruby on Rails. Unlike others, this does not setup a full working application - instead, it just installs the environment needed for developing Rails applications.
Added a script installer for Typo, which makes use of the Ruby on Rails framework but is a full blogging application.
Fixed a bug that can prevent per-domain PHP configurations from working when running PHP via CGI scripts.
Added the status of the Dovecot IMAP/POP3 server to the server status section of the right frame.

Webalizer statistics are now included in cPanel migrations.
Added a script installer for Mephisto, a Ruby on Rails Blog.
Ruby on Rails script directories are now protected from regular web access via a .htaccess file, as they are always accessed via a proxy.
Added an installer for Radiant, a Ruby on Rails content management system. Unfortunately it can only be reliably installed at the top level of a virtual server's web directory.
When a virtual server is deleted, all Mongrel server processes for Ruby on Rails applications associated with it are stopped, and prevented from starting at boot time.
Added checks for gcc and make to the Ruby on Rails script installers (needed to compile the MySQL driver), and make checking for commands by scripts more generic.
Added a restriction to the Edit Owner Limits page to prevent the creation of catchall email aliases.
Added fields to the autoreply section of the alias and user email forwarding pages to limit the date range on which replies are sent.
Added a Module Config option to delete aliases when email is disabled for a domain.

Migrated cPanel users with forwarding have email also delivered to their inbox, to maintain consistency with cPanel.
Added a script installer for the Movable Type blogging platform.
When an existing database is imported to a virtual server, the MySQL or PostgreSQL permissions to it are properly granted. Similarly, when a database is dis-associated, permissions to it and directory group permissions are properly removed.
In the Server Templates section, separate template php.ini files can be specified for PHP versions 4 and 5.
Added --alias, --toplevel, --subserver and --subdomain parameters to list-domains.pl to limit output.
Added the Excluded Directories page for entering directories not to include in backups for a virtual server.
Updated the modify-domain.pl script to allow excluded directories to be managed with the --add-exclude and --remove-exclude parameters. Also updated list-domains.pl to show exclusions.
When enabling or disabling proxying for a domain, existing Apache directives are no longer re-generated from the template.
Added a new tab to the Script Installers page under System Settings to send daily emails to domain owners, resellers or the master administrator notifying them of scripts that have new versions available.
Re-factored the code in all script installers that extracts ZIP and TAR archives to better check for domains that are out of disk quota, to prevent partial installs.
Added an option to the form for backing up a single virtual server to download the resulting file in the browser, rather than saving it to a file or sending to an SSH or FTP server.
The button to stop or restart ProFTPd is always displayed in the right frame, even if private IP-based FTP is not enabled.
Added a field to the Website Options page to set the number of PHP sub-processes used for service fCGId requests. A default for this can also be set in the Server Templates section, and the setting can be changed for multiple domains at once on the Update Virtual Servers.
Added the --php-children parameter to the modify-web.pl command-line script, to change the number of PHP fCGId sub-processes. The current setting is also displayed in list-domains.pl.
---- Changes since 3.45 ----

On the Upgrade Scripts page for upgrading across multiple domains at once, only show those actually used in the menu.
Renamed the phpSurveyor installer to Limesurvey, and updated the version 1.52.
Added a script installer for WordPress MU version 1.2.4. This is the multi-user version of the popular WordPress blogging engine.

Better handle additional databases in domains that start with a number, by converting the first digit to a word.
Added a Module Config option to control use of the batch domain creation form by domain owners.
Fixed bugs on the batch creation form that allowed domain owners to add new top-level servers, or sub-servers under domains that they don't own!
Added links from the CPU load, memory used, disk used and other information on the right-hand system information page to graphs showing their values over time. This is taken from data collected by Virtualmin starting with the installation of this new release.
In the Quota commands section of the Module Config page, added two new commands to get the quotas for a single user and group respectively. If defined, Virtualmin will use these when listing users in a domain or editing a single user, on the assumption that they are faster than the command which outputs quotas for all users.
Creation of domains that match certain regular expressions can be denied using a new Module Config option in the Defaults for new domains section.
Added the --only-features parameter to restore-domain.pl, which tells Virtualmin to only enable features selected for restore when creating a new domain as part of the process.
Added a similar option to the restore form in the Virtualmin web interface.
Usage for previous months can be shown on the Bandwidth Monitoring page, using a month selector menu at the bottom of the table of domains or dates.
Added options on the Edit Server Template page to make some non-default template the one that is initially selected when adding new virtual servers, migrating them or creating from a batch file.
---- Changes since 3.46 ----

Added support for migrating domains from Plesk 8 backups.
The migration function will use the username and password from the original domain where possible, removing the need to specify them manually when on the migration form or as parameters to migrate-domain.pl. For Plesk backups the original username and password can be retrieved, while for Ensim and cPanel only the username can be found automatically.
The System Settings category on the left menu of the framed theme is now broken down into 5 smaller menus, to make things easier to find.
Updated the Xoops script installer to automate the database connection and administration user creation, so that you no longer have to go through the install wizard manually.
Added an option to the Create alias websites by setting in server templates to use RedirectMatch instead of Redirect, which is more Google-friendly for parked domains.
If password quality restrictions are setup in the Webmin Users module, enforce them in Virtualmin too.
Removed the ability to select the SpamAssassin client program and ClamAV virus filter on a per-domain basis, or in templates. This is now configured using the new Spam and Virus Scanning page, which effects all virtual servers.
Added the set-spam.pl command-line program, which modifies the spam and virus scanners for all virtual servers at once.
Expanded the plugin API to allow plugins to add their own links to the System Settings menus.
Moved the buttons for disabling and enabling multiple virtual servers off the Update Virtual Servers page to the domains list where they are more visible, and added confirmation pages.
Plugin modules can now define additional sections to appear on the right-hand side of the framed theme, and new global options to appear in the System Settings categories on the left.
The default number of alias servers that new virtual server owners can create can now be set on the Server Templates page.
Removed the Plugin Modules page and the section for enabled features from the Module Config page, and merged them into a single Features and Plugins page where you can select which are enabled.
Added a button to the Spam and Virus Scanning page to configure and start clamd, so that the clamdscan virus scanner can be used to save on CPU.
---- Changes since 3.47 ----
Updated Xoops script installer to version 2.0.17.1, SugarCRM to 4.5.1f, TikiWiki to 1.9.8, Rails to 1.2.3, Radiant to 0.6.3, phpBB to 3.0.RC7, dotProject to 2.1, and SquirrelMail to version 1.4.11.
Updated the Horde script installer to version 3.1.5, along with many Horde applications like IMP and Kronolith.
Domains that don't have any databases but are allowed to create one can now install scripts that have the ability to create a database.
When re-creating a domain as part of a restore, the external DNS IP address is set to match the target system, rather than being copied from the source.
Added the CA Certificate tab to the Manage SSL Certificate page, for uploading a chained cert from your CA.
If the create of the Unix user or group for a virtual server fails, both are rolled back to avoid leaving half-created users in /etc/passwd or LDAP.
Virtualmin plugins and modules that are not installed but could be are now in the right-hand frame, with a link to the Package Updates module to install them.
Updated the proxy paths page to allow proxying paths to a single URL, even on systems that don't have mod_proxy_balancer installed. For those with a module, the proxy can still be to multiple URLs.
Changed default PHPlist version to stable release 2.10.5.
Added a field to the Upgrade Notification section of the Script Installers page to specify a custom base URL for Webmin for email messages.
On systems with the mod_proxy_balancer Apache module, Ruby-based script installers can run multiple Mongrel instances to handle higher loads. All needed proxy directives and server processes are setup automatically.
Cleaned up the reseller editing page by breaking down fields into collapsible sections.
The hosting provider's logo that appears in the top-left corner can now be customized on a per-reseller basis, so that customers of each reseller see a different logo when they login.
Added --logo and --link parameters to create-reseller.pl and modify-reseller.pl, to set the logo their customers see, and updated list-resellers.pl to show the current logo for each reseller.
Added an option to the proxy paths page to serve locally for some path (disable proxying). Also added a corresponding flag to the create-proxy.pl command-line API.
When batch creating or mass deleting virtual servers, servers like Apache and BIND are not restarted to apply the changes until the entire batch is complete.
Scripts that have a background server process (like Mongrel instances for Ruby on Rails) can now be stopped, started and restarted from the Manage Script page.
Added an option to the Edit Mailbox page to disable spam filtering for a user. Also added equivalent command-line flags to the user modify-user.pl and create-user.pl command-line scripts.
---- Changes since 3.48 ----

Logging is now enabled when setting up clamd, and the socket directory created if needed.
Added 5 and 15 minute load averages to system statistics.
Details of a virtual server's resellers are now made available to pre and post virtual server change commands in the RESELLER_ environment variables.
Reseller details can now be used in templates and email messages, with keys like RESELLER_NAME and RESELLER_EMAIL.
When a domain is renamed, generics or sender canonical maps are properly updated too.
MySQL and LDAP sources for aliases and virtual addresses for Postfix can now be used by Virtualmin, when Webmin 1.380 or newer is installed and when they are setup properly in the Postfix module. This allows Virtualmin to effectively configure a remote mail server, assuming that domain Unix users and groups are also stored in LDAP.
Current versions are shown in the script updates notification email.
Errors when extracting cPanel, Plesk and Ensim backup files are reported in more detail.
Sub-domains in cPanel backups can now be properly imported.
Virtualin plugins can now export script installers, using the scripts_list function in virtual_feature.pl.
Added the --user command-line option to backup-domain.pl to backup all domains owned by some Virtualmin user.
Added a checkbox to the backup form to include sub-servers of those selected too. A similar option is also available to virtual server owners when backing up a single domain, to include all sub-servers with the same owner.
Added the --user option to disable-feature.pl and enable-feature.pl to turn features off and on in all domains owned by some user, and the list-domains.pl to fnd domains by user.
Both the maximum and minimum versions for scripts can now be selected on the global Script Installers page.
Added the --user and --all-domains parameters to list-scripts.pl, list-users.pl, list-aliases.pl and list-simple-aliases.pl, to list objects in multiple domains.
---- Changes since 3.49 ----
When used, the ClamAV server clamd can be stopped and started from the system information page, just like MySQL and Apache.
Added the original website URLs for all script installers, displayed on the installation form and on the page showing details of an installed script.
Updated the phpMyAdmin script installer to 2.11.3, OpenAds to 2.4.2, phpBB to 3.0.RC8, ZenCart to 1.3.8, Plans Calendar to 7.9.8, Drupal to 5.5 and 4.7.10, Squirrelmail to 1.4.12, PHP-Calendar to 0.10.9, Flyspray to 0.9.9.4, and Instiki 0.12.0.
The initial administration login and password is displayed after installing a script.
Advanced autoreply options are hidden by default, to make the alias form less confusing.
When re-sending the signup email for a server, the owner's email address can be entered.
When there are too many servers on the List Virtual Servers page to show in a table, buttons to update and delete them all are displayed along with the seach form.
Added a Module Config option to make the Unix group name for a new domain always follow the username, and made group name selection more consistent across creation methods.
Moved the Administration username field into the first (visible) section of the Create Virtual Server page.
Cron jobs created by Virtualmin will still be recognized even if manually modified to redirect output or add other pre- and post-commands.
Virtualmin API scripts run via HTTP are now executed within the same process, which should make them about twice as fast.
Alias mail domains can now be implemented by copying virtusers into the alias rather than using a catchall. Under Postfix this allows email to invalid addresses in the alias domain to be rejected at the SMTP level. The default for this can be changed on the Server Templates page under Mail for domain, and it can be changed for existing domains on the Edit Virtual Server page.
Added the modify-aliascopy.pl command-line program to change the email aliasing mode (from catchall to copying virtusers).
Added --mailfiles flag to backup-domain.pl and restore-domain.pl, to save and restore inboxes outside of the home directory.
Shells for mailboxes and domain owners are now configured on the new Custom Shells page, linked under System Customization on the left menu. This allows you to define as many different shells as you like, for access levels like email only, FTP and SCP only. When editing mailboxes or domain owner limits, you can then select one of the defined shells.
Added the list-available-shells.pl command-line program, and added the --shell parameter to create-user.pl and modify-user.pl. Also updated modify-limits.pl so that the --shell option can specify any defined shell.
The size of the Webmin server process can be traded off against the speed of Virtualmin by adjusting the amount of library pre-loading done, using a new setting on the Module Config page.
Added the test-smtp.pl command for validating mail server relaying and logins.
---- Changes since 3.50 ----
Upgraded the SquirrelMail script installer to version 1.4.13, phpBB to 3.0.0 (and fixed a module bug), TikiWiki to 1.9.9, Gallery to 2.2.4, Xoops to 2.0.18, WordPress to 2.3.2, and Mantis to 1.1.0.
Upgraded the ZenPhoto installer to version 1.1.3, and made it more automated.
Removed the Squirrelmail 1.5.1 version, as it is no longer available for download.
Only run clamscan once to verify that it is working, rather than after every configuration change.
Include the total backup time in the scheduled backup email.
Added a script installer for RoundCube, a new IMAP webmail client with a nicer user interface than Squirrelmail.
Added back the old one-file-per-domain backup format, which is more friendly to rsyncing the home directory separately.
Moved the default quota for mailboxes to the 'Mail for domain' section of templates.
Shell special characters like ; and & are no longer allowed in mailbox usernames.
When selecting a database for a script, the default is now to use a new DB if possible.
When installing a script that uses authentication, you can now enter a username and/or password instead of it being setup to use the domain's login details by default. Similarly, the install-script.pl command now has optional --user and --pass parameters.
When using Postfix with the sender_bcc_maps directive, a new option on the Module Config page can be used to allow BCCing all sent email in some or all domains to a separate address. This can be set on the Email Settings page, or by default for new domains in Server Templates. It can also be changed on the command line with the new modify-mail.pl script.
Removed the modify-aliascopy.pl command-line program, as it's features have been included in modify-mail.pl.
Fixed a bug that prevented mail for users with @ in their names and mbox-format mail files from being properly displayed on systems using Postfix.
When an alias domain is created, the primary domain can now update its configuration as needed. This allows AWstats to work when accessed via the alias domain.
Un-supported script versions can now be installed by the master admin .. but use this feature at your own risk!
Put back the osTicket installer, now that it is available again, and updated it to version 1.6 RC2.
Added a script installer for eTicket version 1.5.6-RC4, a fork of the osTicket project.
The system statistics graphs can now be displayed using IE, as well as Firefox.
---- Changes since 3.51 ----

When restoring a virtual server that uses features not supported on the system, a warning will be displayed listing the missing or disabled features.
Custom styles can use the nocontent=1 line in style.info to specify that no initial content needs to be entered.
When moving a virtual server to a new system via a restore, if any required PHP modules that were installed on the old system are missing on the new, they will be automatically installed (where possible). In addition, you will be notified if any required PHP versions are missing.
When editing a virtual server without a private IP address, one can be added that is associated with an existing interface on the system.
When a domain is restored to a system with a new IP address, the IP in the SPF record is updated. Also, any NS records are updated to match the new system.
When a virtual server is moved under a new owner, the Apache directives that control which user CGIs and PHP scripts run as are properly updated.
Fixed bugs in the FAQMasterFlex installer that prevented it's config file from being setup properly.
Re-wrote all code that locks configuration files managed by Virtualmin. This improves the coverage of Webmin logging, and makes it much safer to perform multiple operations on the same or different domains at once.
Outgoing email relayed via the Virtualmin system is now counted towards the sender's domain's bandwidth limit, unless disabled on the Bandwidth Monitoring page.
Moved the option that controls if mailbox users can have .procmailrc files to the Spam and Virus Delivery page, where it is easier to find and is applied immediately.
The wrapper scripts for running PHP via CGI or fastCGI now have the immutable flag set on Linux, to prevent accidental deletion by domain owners.
New features in this version of Virtualmin and any plugins are shown on the System Information page, if using the Virtualmin theme.

Updated the WordPress installer to version 2.3.3, WordPress MU to 1.3.3, Rails to 2.0.2, Typo to 5.0.2, Radiant to 0.6.4, Turba to h3-2.1.7, Xoops to 2.0.18.1, phpBB to 2.0.23, TikiWiki to 1.9.10.1, and Joomla to 1.5.1 and 1.0.15.
Renamed the OpenAds installer to OpenX, and updated it to version 2.4.4.
The --quota and --mail-quota parameters to create-user.pl are now optional. If missing the defaults for the domain or template will be used.
Added the check-config.pl command line script for validating the Virtualmin configuration.
Apache log files outside a domain's home directory are renamed and deleted when appropriate.
Hitting Stop in the browser during the creation of a virtual server or some other action will no longer cancel it, which prevents domains from being half created.
When the Apache virtual host *.domain exists and a new virtual host for something.domain is created, it is placed before *.domain in the Apache config file to give it precedence.
SSL can now be enabled for domains without a private IP address, for a single virtual server on each shared address. This means that on a typical single-IP system, you can have one SSL website. This replaces the --ip-primary flag to create-domain.pl.
The logrotate configuration is now validated by Virtualmin, to detect duplicate entries that can cause rotation to stop working.
The SpamAssassin version is validated as part of the configuration check, to ensure that it supports the needed --siteconfigpath parameter.
Vpopmail systems with so many domains that letter-suffix directories under /home/vpopmail/domains are needed are now handed by Virtualmin.
When a DNS domain is disabled, all records in it that use the domain name are renamed too, to keep BIND happy.
Added the --features-from-template parameter to create-domain.pl, to use features based on limits defined in the template.
If a script package cannot be downloaded from the vendor's website, Virtualmin will fall back to using a copy from scripts.virtualmin.com. This protects against changes made to script vendor's websites or download repositories.
---- Changes since 3.53 ----
When your Virtualmin Pro license is within 7 days of expiry, a notification is displayed on the system information page when the master administrator logs in.
Updated the LimeSurvey script installer to version 1.70, ZenPhoto to 1.1.5, phpMyAdmin to 2.11.5, SugarCRM to 5.0.0b, Horde to 3.1.7, and Flyspray to 0.9.9.5.
Fixed bugs in Plesk migration, and added automatic detection of alias domains in the original backup. SSL certificates and keys from the backup are also migrated. Also added initial support for Windows Plesk backups.
A domain's private IP and external IP for DNS are now also included in SPF records.
When restoring a backup, switch to a supported PHP execution mode if the original Apache config used an un-supported mode.
A default email template for status monitors can now be defined, when using Webmin 1.404 or later.
Added a check for Sendmail not accepting email on the external interface, which is the default in some distributions.
Updated the b2evolution, DotProject, FAQMasterFlex, Advanced Guestbook, Help Center Live, Integramod, Nucleus, PHPwebsite and PollPHP script installers to support PHP version 5.
When a sub-domain is created with the same name as a record in the parent domain, the record is not removed whem the domain is deleted.
When using Qmail, domains with the same name as the system's primary hostname (typically from the <tt>control/me</tt> file) are not longer allowed, as they break Virtualmin's use of the <tt>virtualdomains</tt> file.
When email is disabled for a domain, only MX and mail records pointing to the Virtualmin system or known secondaries are removed.
When restoring a backup of a domain that doesn't exist on the system, it's IP address can be changed or re-allocated from the range available on your system. This makes migration of domains with private IP addresses between systems on different networks easier.
The list of new features includes the date Virtualmin was installed.
Email to domain owners for over-bandwidth warnings, new script notifications and others can now come from their resellers' addresses, if set. This behaviour must be enabled using a new setting on the <b>Module Config</b> page, under <b>Actions upon server and user creation</b>.
---- Changes since 3.54 ----

New DNS domains have the localhost A record added, with an IP of 127.0.0.1.
When a script is installed into a path that is already served by a proxy (such as for a rails application on /), a negating proxy rule is added so that the script is accessible.
When migrating a domain from other control panel like Plesk, you can now select to have to downloaded directly from a remote FTP or SSH server. The migrate-domain.pl command-line script also allows use of ftp:// or ssh:// URLs for backup sources.
If the skeleton directory contains a public_html sub-directory, it is copied to a sub-domain's web pages directory when the domain is created.
For alias domains whose virtusers are always copied from the target, no home directory is created (as it isn't needed).
The path to the public_html and cgi-bin directories is now stored in each new domain's data file, so that they are correctly preserved when the path is changed in the template, or the domain is moved to another system with a different directory name.
Basic Exim support, thanks to Bill Moyers and John Gray.
When migrating a cPanel, Plesk or Ensim backup, the original domain name can now be worked out automatically, as long as the backup contains just one.
For new installs, new features in older versions are not shown on the System Information page.
Fixed the modification of Webalizer and Logrotate config files when a domain's Apache logs are outside it's home directory.
Apache logs outside a domain's home directory are now included in backups and restores.
Added the --delete-existing flag to migrate-domain.pl, to remove any existing virtual server with the same name before re-migrating.
Plesk sub-domains are now included with migrating, including any users for managing their content.
The background collectinfo.pl cron job can be run less frequently or disabled using a new Module Config page option.
Added a script to change the Virtualmin license in all needed files on an already installed system.
Added the Magento eCommerce package to Virtualmin's script installers, version 1.0.
Added the --name-only flag to all list-* command-line API programs, to output just object names for easier use in scripts.
Leftover /tmp/clamav-* files older than 1 day are now periodically deleted by Virtualmin.
The pre-change script now has access to the settings that will be applied in $VIRTUALSERVER_NEWSERVER_* variables, while the $VIRTUALSERVER_* variables always contain the domain's settings before the change is made.
Users in domains with spam filtering enabled can have their auto-whitelists viewed and edited, using a new link on the Edit Mailbox page (which using Webmin 1.411 or later).
---- Changes since 3.55 ----
Added the list-mailbox.pl command-line script, for dumping a user's mail.
Added a script insaller for poMMo, a new web-based mailing list manager.
Link from the Edit Database page to scripts that use the DB.
When a script does not get fully installed (perhaps due to Virtualmin not being able to call its setup wizard), it is marked as a partial failure rather than a complete failure. This allows it be easily removed without leaving files behind.
Wordpress, WPMU and bbPress are now downloaded from the Virtualmin website in preference to their developer's sites, as there is no way to fetch specific older versions from the original site.
The alias to bounce all mail to unknown addresses in a domain is no longer created when using Postfix, as it does not appear to be necessary.
Updated the phpPgAdmin script installer to version 4.2, phpCOIN to 1.4.1, TikiWiki to 1.9.11, bbPress to 0.9.0.2, Coppermine to 1.4.18, Joomla to 1.5.2, OpenX to 2.4.5, WordPress to 2.5.1, and SugarCRM to 5.0.0c.
Added a Module Config option to prevent creation of the deniedssh group.
Reduced the memory needed to migrated Plesk backups, by not reading the whole source file into RAM for parsing.
When creating a sub-server whose prefix is in use by another domain, a non-clashing prefix for users is automatically selected.
International domain names are now automatically converted to the IDN xn-- format when creating, and converted back for display.
When upgrading scripts in multiple domains at once, added a confirmation page top display and select the domains that will be effected.
The Virtualmin master administrator can now control which domains and users are limited to their home directories when logging in via FTP, using the new FTP Directory Restrictions page.
Cpanel sub-domains are now re-created when migrating their backups.
The default PHP version for one or more virtual servers can be changed with --php-version option to modify-web.pl.
When migrating backups from Postfix-style ~/Maildir inboxes to Sendmail-style /var/mail, mail files are properly copied across.
Changed the content style chooser to display thumbnail images in the drop-down menu.
Added a script installer for Django, a development framework for Python applications.
By default, new virtual servers will no longer have the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable set in the fCGI wrapper files. This avoids a PHP bug that causes stale php-cgi processes to be left running, but may slightly reduce the performance of PHP applications.
Multiple warning thresholds and an interval between sending a notification for each domain can now be configured on the Disk Quota Monitoring page.
For virtual servers using fcgid to run PHP scripts, the IPCCommTimeout is set to the PHP maximum execution time, to avoid long-running scripts not being able to send their output.
---- Changes since 3.56 ----
Updated the eTicket script installer to version 1.5.7, WordPress to 2.5.1, bbPress to 0.9.0.2, Kronolith to 2.1.8, phpMyAdmin to 2.11.6, Joomla 1.5.3, SMF to 1.1.5, Magento to 1.0.19870, phpCOIN to 1.4.2, DokuWiki to 2008-05-05, Bugzilla to 3.1.4, OpenX to 2.4.6, WordPress MU to 1.5.1, Django to 0.96.2, and SugarCRM to 5.0.0d.

Updated the Drupal script installer to support version 6.2.
Added a script installer for Piwik, an open-source web analytics tool.
Post-change scripts have access to the settings of a virtual server before it was changed in the VIRTUALSERVER_OLDSERVER_* environment variables.
If MySQL or PostgreSQL have no root password set, display a warning during the configuration check.
AddHandler, FCGIWrapper and RemoveHandler directives not related to PHP versions Virtualmin knows about are not touched when changing PHP settings.
Limits on the number of processes and amount of RAM and CPU time a process can use can be defined for each virtual server. These apply to CGI and PHP scripts, and when the domain owner logs in via SSH. They are particularly useful for preventing fork bombs and other intentional or accidental denial of service attacks.
When a script has dependencies, all are checked and reported at once rather than being displayed one at a time. This makes complex applications like Rails easier to setup.
When scheduled backups are sent to their domain owners as well, each owner only receives the backup messages related to the domains they own.
Added script installers for Trac and MoinMoin, contributed by Jannis Leidel.
---- Changes since 3.57 ----
Mailbox users' passwords are now shown in a separate popup window, rather than on the Edit Mailbox page where anyone can see them.

All new SSL certificate and key files how have 700 permissions, so that only the domain owner and Apache (which starts as root) can read them.
All Virtualmin command-line and remote API programs now participate in Webmin logging, so their invocation and changes can be viewed in the Webmin Actions Log module.
Plesk sub-domains are now imported as Virtualmin sub-servers.
Updated the Horde script installer to version 3.2, and all its associated sub-applications to their latest releases.
The $DNS_SERIAL variable can be used in templates, as an initial serial for new domains.
When a domain's home directory is changed, update session.save_path in its php.ini files to match.
Improved the migration of Plesk mailbox aliases and forwarding, and protected directories.
Fixed support for international domain names using non-european character sets (like Chinese and Cyrillic) in newer versions of Perl.
Completely re-designed the Virtualmin backup UI, to support multiple backup schedules and allow domain owners and resellers to schedule their own backups (subject to limits configured by the master administrator). Domain owners can now also restore backups of their home directories and databases. Backups can either be full or incremental, to speed up the process of backing up large but infrequently-changing sites.
By default, new DNS zones only allow localhost, hosts on the local network and known slaves to transfer records.
All text in the Virtualmin user interface is now available in Dutch, thanks to Gandyman.
The remote hosts from which connections to MySQL are allowed can be easily edited on a per-domain basis on the Edit Databases page, in the new 'Remote hosts' tab. These apply to the domain owner and any mailboxes with database access. The modify-database-hosts.pl command can also be used to edit them from the shell or API.
Old local file and S3 backups created using date-based filenames can now be automatically deleted if older than a selected number of days, configurable on the Scheduled Backups page.

Additional manually configured nameservers can now be more easily entered in server templates, in the BIND DNS domain section.
Converted all command-line API scripts to use POD format documentation.
Added the Virtualmin API helper command /usr/sbin/virtualmin, which lets you more easily call API scripts with a command like "virtualmin list-domains --multiline". Help on commands can also be displayed with like "virtualmin help list-domains".
Purging of old backups made to FTP or SSH servers is now supported, for FTP servers that use Unix directory listings and SSH servers that allow commands to be run.
---- Changes since 3.59 ----

Included domains can now be specified when editing SPF information, and IP networks can be entered.
The default limit on the number of non-alias domains can now be set in server templates.
Added a script installer for Z-push, which implements the Microsoft activesync protocol.
DNS aliases named 'webmail' and 'admin' are now created in all new virtual servers by default, and Apache is configured to redirect requests for them to Usermin and Webmin by default.
Added the Global Variables page under the System Customization category, for creating variables that can be used in all templates.
If the virus scanner fails to return a response within 30 seconds, email will be delivered normally. This avoids problems with the procmail timeout, which can cause even non-infected email to be dropped if clamav is too slow.

Third-party content styles can now be deleted by the master admin from the Content Styles page.
Added the --default-ip flag to modify-domain.pl, to revert to a shared IP address.
Custom links can be limited to virtual servers with a specific template if you have any custom templates defined, for more control over when each link is displayed.
Backups now include any custom template used to create virtual servers, which allow domains to be restored even on systems that do not yet have the original templates.
When a virtual server's IP address is changed, the addresses of all alias domains are updated to match.
The Website Options page now has a field to enable matching all sub-domains for the virtual server's website, via a *.domain.com DNS entry and Apache server alias directive. This can also be enabled for some or all domains using the modify-web.pl command-line API.
If a backup is taken on a system that uses ~/mail for user folders and restored on one using ~/Maildir, they will be properly converted during the restore (and vice-versa).
When a domain is restored on a new system, the MySQL socket file path and options that reference the home directory in its php.ini file are updated to match the new system.
Preserve encrypted passwords when backing up domains, in case they don't match the plaintext password stored by Virtualmin. Also, have validation report an error in the case of a mismatch.

The configuration check now detects a missing or incorrect suexec, to easier find problems with the base directory that will break PHP and CGI scripts.
Added a new sort mode (used by default for new installs) to order virtual servers by domain name, but with sub-servers indented under them.
The frequency of script update notifications and whether to send the same notification twice can now be configured on the Script Installers configuration page.
Resellers can now read mail in all mailboxes under domains they control, if allowed on the Module Config page under 'Extra modules'.
Included domains for SPF for new virtual servers can now be set in server templates.
Added a button to the Edit Mailbox page for logging into Usermin as a user without having to enter their password. Requires Webmin 1.440 or later though.
On FreeBSD, the Gnu tar command gtar is used in preference to regular tar when installed. This allows incremental backups to be performed.
When MySQL is on a remote system, the 'show table status' command is used to get an approximate size for each database.

Ensure that resource limits (CPU, RAM and procesess) are never set for the Apache user, even when it is a member of a domain's group for which limits are set.
Plugins can now define additional inputs to appear on the Create Virtual Server page and accepted by create-domain.pl, for options specific to the plugin's feature.
The master administrator can now grant himself access to scripts disabled for regular users, with a new form on the Script Installers page.
When the user or group for a domain is changed, references to the old user or group in lgorotate.conf are updated to the new values.

On systems running Postfix with spam filtering enabled, the ownership and permissions on the procmail wrapper command are validated as part of the configuration check to ensure that it is setuid and setgid to root.
When a virtual server with slave DNS zones is disabled, then will be removed from slave servers to properly prevent DNS resolution of the domain. When it is re-enabled, the slave zones will be re-created.
Optimized the spam and virus deletion screen to deal better with large folders, by processing only 100 messages at a time.
Added a check to ensure that the Webalizer template configuration file actually exists.
Multiple virtual servers with SSL enabled can now share the same IP address. However, Virtualmin will display a warning message if a new domain does not match the hostname in the certificate for an existing domain.
UCC certificates and CSRs can now be created and displayed on the Manage SSL Certificate page.
Domain owners can now restore from files under their virtualmin-backup directory, subject to regular Unix permissions.
FTP directory restrictions can now be included in Virtualmin configuration backups.
Custom nameservers can now be defined for resellers, so that domains they create can appear to be hosted on a server separate from other resellers or the master admin.

Email sent to domain owners is now properly encoded so that non-ASCII characters can be included.
Added a checkbox to the Shared IP Addresses page to allocate a new shared IP, if allocation ranges have been defined.
Shared IP addresses can now be listed, added and removed from the command line using the new list-shared-addresses.pl, create-shared-address.pl and delete-shared-address.pl scripts.
Virtual server backups can now be in ZIP format, by changing the 'Backup compression format' option on the Module Config page. TAR format is still recommended though, as it better preserves Unix filesystem attributes.
When submitting a new SSL certificate and key, they are checked to ensure a modulus match, ensuring that they were generated and can be used together.
