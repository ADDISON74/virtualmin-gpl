<header>Proxy Balancers</header>

Proxy balancers allow you to map a URL path in a virtual server's website
to one or more destination URLs. This is typically used to make Ruby on Rails
applications served by multiple Mongrel instances available under a URL
path in the server's website. <p>

For example, you might map the path <tt>/radiant</tt> to the URLs <tt>http://localhost:3001</tt> and <tt>http://localhost:3002</tt>, which are the ports for
two Mongrel instances serving the same application running on your Virtualmin
system. <p>
