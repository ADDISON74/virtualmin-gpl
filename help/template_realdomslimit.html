<header>Default limit on number of non-alias servers</header>

If the domain owner has sub-server creation privileges, you may limit the number of non-alias servers that can be created here. Note that this limit cannot be effectively higher than the <b>Default limit on number of virtual servers</b>, as the overall limit on virtual servers applies to both alias and non-alias domains.<p>

This is useful if you want to allow a domain owner to create an unlimited or
higher number of alias servers, but limit the more expensive sub-servers he
can create. <p>
