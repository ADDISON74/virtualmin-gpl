<header>Default FCGId PHP sub-processes</header>

When PHP scripts are run via FCGId, each domain will have the number of PHP processes
set in this field running at all times to serve requests. You
can increase this from the default of 4 to improve PHP script latency, or
decrease it to reduce memory use. <p>
