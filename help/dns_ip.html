<header>IP address for use in DNS records</header>

By default, the DNS records automatically generated for this virtual server
will contain the IP address that it is assigned by Virtualmin. However, in 
some cases this address may not actually be the one you want web and mail
clients on the Internet to connect to. <p>

This can occur if your Virtualmin server is on an internal private network,
and all HTTP traffic is forwarded to it via a firewall or proxy. In this case,
it is the firewall's IP address that the DNS records should contain. When this
option is set, the address entered will be used for all records that would
normally contain the real address, such as <tt>www</tt>, <tt>mail</tt> and
<tt>ftp</tt>. <p>
