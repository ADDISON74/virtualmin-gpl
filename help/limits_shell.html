<header>Allowed login type</header>

This setting determines how the administrator for this domain is allowed to
login. The available options are :<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>No login</b>
<dd>Both FTP and SSH logins are blocked.
<dt><b>FTP only</b>
<dd>The user can connect via FTP, but not via SSH or telnet.
<dt><b>SSH and FTP</b>
<dd>Logins via FTP, SSH and telnet are allowed.
</dl>

Because this feature works by changing the virtual server Unix user's shell,
it assumes that your FTP server uses the <tt>/etc/shells</tt> file for
authentication. <p>
