<header>Add mail attribute to LDAP users?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, Webmin will add LDAP <tt>mail</tt> attributes
to each user it creates or modifies for their primary and additional email
addresses. This is useful if you are using the same LDAP database with a 
mail server which uses that attribute to figure out where to deliver email.
