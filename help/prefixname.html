<header>Prefix for mail usernames?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will append or prepend the first part of the domain name to all mailbox users create in this domain, in order to ensure there are no username clashes. However, this field can be used to specify a different prefix or suffix, which can be useful if your system has a short username length like (like FreeBSD) and the default prefix is too long. <p>
