<header>Mail server to configure</header>
Selects the mailserver that is configured.  Postfix, Sendmail and QMail (in several variants) are supported.  Postfix is the default in Virtualmin Professional systems, and all documentation is focused on Postfix.  The other mail servers are fully supported by Virtualmin, however, so if you have a strong reason to choose an alternative to Postfix, you can do so here.
