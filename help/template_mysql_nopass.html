<header>Keep MySQL and administration passwords in sync?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will change the MySQL password for a domain when
the administration password changes. Howver, this will cause problems for
any installed applications that have already been configured with the old
password. To avoid this, change this setting to <b>No</b>. <p>
