<header>Backup compression format</header>

By default, Virtualmin uses gzip compression on its backup files. However, this
option can be used to select the more efficient (but CPU-intensive) bzip2 
format instead. Alternately, you can select to create un-compressed tar format
backups, which may be useful if writing to tape. <p>
