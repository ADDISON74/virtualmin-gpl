<header>Allow mailbox users to configure procmail?</header>

When this option is set to No, Procmail will be configured to not
execute the .procmailrc files in users' home directories. This is generally
a good idea, as it prevents un-trusted mail users from running commands and
writing to arbitrary files by manipulating their Procmail configurations.<p>
