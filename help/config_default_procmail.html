<header>Allow mailbox users to create mail filters?</header>

When this option is set to No, Procmail will be configured to not
execute the .procmailrc files in users' home directories, which prevents any
mail filters created by users from running. This is generally
a good idea, as it prevents un-trusted mail users from running commands and
writing to arbitrary files by manipulating their Procmail configurations.<p>
