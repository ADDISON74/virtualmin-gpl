Custom fields allow the administrator to include additional link that appear
in the left frame when a virtual server is selected. Each link has the following
attributes :<p>

<dd>The text of the link. This can include substitions like $DOM and $USER, which are replaced by details of the selected domain.

<dt><b>Destination URL</b>
<dd>The full URL that the link points to. Again, substitions like $DOM can be used.

<dt><b>Open in window</b>
<dd>If <b>Same</b> is selected, the link will open in the right-side frame. If <b>New</b> is chosen, it will open in a separate top-level browser window.

<dt><b>Visible to</b>
<dd>The boxes checked here determine if the link is available to the master admin, domain owner and/or resellers.

<dt><b>Category</b>
<dd>If you have defined any custom categories for links (at the bottom of this page), you can select a category for each link in this column.

Links can be re-ordered using the arrows in the <b>Move</b> column, if you
have defined more than one.<p>

At the bottom of the page is a form for entering or modifying categories
for custom links. These are displayed as expandable sections in the framed
themes, with the links chosen to be in each category appearing under the 
section header when it is open. <p>
