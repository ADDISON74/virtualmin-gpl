<header>Allow access to databases</header>

This field allows you to select which databases owned by this virtual server
the user can also login to. To add a database, select it from the left-hand
list and click the -&gt; arrow. <p>

The user's login and password will be the same as those he would use for
FTP or IMAP. By default, he will be granted full access to all tables in
the selected databases. <p>
