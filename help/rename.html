<header>Change Domain Name</header>

This form can be used to change the domain name of an existing virtual server. By default the username and home directory will also be adjusted to match the new domain, assuming that they are based on it.<p>

It can also be used to change either the administration username or the home directory without touching the domain name at all, for example if you want to move to a new base directory. Only the master administrator can change the username or move the home to an artbitrary location though.<p>

By default, existing mailbox users in the domain are not renamed so that their IMAP logins sitll work. You can force a change by setting the <b>Rename mail / FTP users too?</b> field to <b>Yes</b> though.<p>
