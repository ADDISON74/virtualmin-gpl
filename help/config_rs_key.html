<header>Default Rackspace API key for backups</header>

This field can be used to set the default Rackspace Cloud Files API key used
for new backups to Rackspace by the master admin, and by Virtualmin API calls.
This is useful to avoid having to enter the secret key for every backup or
API command. <p>
