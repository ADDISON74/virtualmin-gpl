<header>Scheduled backup enabled?</header>

To enable the automatic backup, this field must be set to <b>Yes, at times
selected below ..</b>, and a valid schedule chosen using the menus below it.
The easier option is to select <b>Simple schedule</b> and choose <b>Daily</b>
from the adjacent menu. <p>

If you need more control over the schedule, choose the <b>Times and dates
selected below ..</b> option and then select the minutes, hours, days,
months and weekdays you want the backup to be run at. <p>
