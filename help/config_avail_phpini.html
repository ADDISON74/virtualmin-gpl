<header>PHP Configuration (for domain's php.ini files)</header>

When enabled, this option grants virtual server owners access to the 
PHP Configuration module. This will be restricted so that they can only
manage <tt>php.ini</tt> files in their own virtual servers, for which
PHP execution via CGI is enabled. <p>
