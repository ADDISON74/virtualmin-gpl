<header>Master DNS server hostname</header>

By default, Virtualmin will use the system's hostname in the primary NS

a valid DNS name or it not suitable for your purposes, this option can
be used to enter a different primary nameserver. If <b>must</b> resolve
to the externally accessible IP address of your system though. <p>
