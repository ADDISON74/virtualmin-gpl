<header>Maximum message size to process for spamc</header>

To prevent huge email messages from being sent over a network connection
from <tt>spamc</tt> to the <tt>spamd</tt> server, this option can be used to
limit the maximum scanned message size. Large messages (above 10MB) are rarely
spam, so not scanning them is unlikely to increase the amount of spam that
gets through. <p>
