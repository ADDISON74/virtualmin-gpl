 - separate backup schedule for each domain (or group of domains?)
	- behave like templates, with first stored in config and others in files
	- need to be able to backup backup schedules

 - refactor UID / GID allocation code, to one place (setup_unix?)

 - NIS support for users DB
	- Cluster mode - each feature on a separate server

 - Allow domain owners to backup multiple domains at once (aliases,etc)

 - Automatically include alias domains in backups

 - When changing a domain's password, username or domain, update all script
   installers.

 - Allow resellers and domain owners to use remote API
	- Need access control enforcement in .pl scripts

 - Separate plans (sets of limits) from templates, so that they can be
   created by resellers.
	- When creating domain, plan can override template.

 - pre-load ui-lib.pl ?

 - better coverage of files by webmin_log

 - cron time selector is too complex - use popup

 - templates for new mailing list configs

 - sub-servers owned by different mailbox user, as suggested by filip
	- perhaps combine with extra admins?

 - backup should include backup settings, and re-create cron job
	- and Usermin settings?

 - new fcgid mode, as suggested by filip
	Action php5-fcgi /fcgi-bin/php5-fcgi
	AddHandler php5-fcgi .php
	<Directory /home/xxx/fcgi-bin>
	Options ExecCGI
	SetHandler fcgid-script
	</Location>

 - Domain registration plugin, via API
	- Who pays?
	- Needs a page for setting up account
 
 - rails scripts should be able to make use of balancer

 - xoops installer should be more automated

 - is there any point having per-domain spam and virus filtering programs?
