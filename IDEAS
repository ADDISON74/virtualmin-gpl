 - separate backup schedule for each domain (or group of domains?)
	- behave like templates, with first stored in config and others in files
	- need to be able to backup backup schedules

 - refactor UID / GID allocation code, to one place (setup_unix?)

 - NIS support for users DB
	- Cluster mode - each feature on a separate server

 - When changing a domain's password, username or domain, update all script
   installers.

 - Allow resellers and domain owners to use remote API
	- Need access control enforcement in .pl scripts

 - Separate plans (sets of limits) from templates, so that they can be
   created by resellers.
	- When creating domain, plan can override template.

 - pre-load ui-lib.pl ?

 - better coverage of files by webmin_log

 - cron time selector is too complex - use popup

 - templates for new mailing list configs

	- test on virgin system
	- openldap server module

   modifying config file, when Webmin 1.380 is out

 - security updates and apt pinning
	- http://www.virtualmin.com/forums/virtualmin/re%3adebian-backports-and-virtualmin.html#8423

 - only load plugins on demand, to save on memory
	 - check and cache which functions are supported, to avoid need for
	   plugin_defined call
	 - no need for preloading their libs
	 - no need for variable to not load plugins
	 - module config option for loading module (full, core only, none)
	 - update preloads after config change / feature change

 - allow shells list (with descriptions) to be configurable for domain owners
	- GPL too
	- remove from config.info
	- include in backups (config)
	- command-line setting
	- fix module config check
	- change all code that uses shells from config (user list too)
	- mass user updates
	- user defaults
	- batch user creation
	- migration user creation

 - pages that do multiple remote calls fail on later ones?
