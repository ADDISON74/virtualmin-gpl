 - separate backup schedule for each domain (or group of domains?)
	- behave like templates, with first stored in config and others in files
	- need to be able to backup backup schedules

 - NIS support for users DB
	- Cluster mode - each feature on a separate server

 - When changing a domain's password, username or domain, update all script
   installers.

 - Allow resellers and domain owners to use remote API
	- Need access control enforcement in .pl scripts

 - Separate plans (sets of limits) from templates, so that they can be
   created by resellers.
	- When creating domain, plan can override template.

 - pre-load ui-lib.pl ?

 - better coverage of files by webmin_log

 - templates for new mailing list configs

 - script installers for
	- phpmyfamily (bug 800)
	- tutos (bug 801)
	- owl intranet knowledge base (802)
	- openbiblio (bug 803)
	- cslh (bug 804)
	- autoindex PHP script (805)
	- jupload (806)

	- another groupware (552)
	- RT (863)
	- RTFM (863)
	- OTRS (863)
	- phpMySites
	- counters (FS 3348)

 - new fcgid mode, as suggested by filip
	Action php5-fcgi /fcgi-bin/php5-fcgi
	AddHandler php5-fcgi .php
	<Directory /home/xxx/fcgi-bin>
	Options ExecCGI
	SetHandler fcgid-script
	</Location>

 - LDAP docs

 - use new Apache module function for block updates instead of directly
   modifying config file, when Webmin 1.380 is out

 - security updates and apt pinning
	- http://www.virtualmin.com/forums/virtualmin/re%3adebian-backports-and-virtualmin.html#8423

 - only load plugins on demand, to save on memory
	 - check and cache which functions are supported, to avoid need for
	   plugin_defined call
	 - no need for preloading their libs
	 - no need for variable to not load plugins

 - global lock on domain DB, to prevent problems with concurrent ops
	- or do better per-feature locking, ie. Apache and BIND and user DB
	- each feature has an obtain_lock_XXX function, which locks some
	  config file and flushes all in-memory caches (unless already locked
	  by this process, in which case it does nothing)
	- FS #3500
	- move all locking to obtain_lock_* functions.
	- Need to do web, webalizer, ssl, spam, virus, webmin
	- Need release_lock functions too
	- Remove debugging code
	- All CGIs and .pl scripts that do something should call appropriate
	  lock function first
	- Remove all other calls to locking code
	- obtain_lock functions should do nothing if config{'xxx'} is not set
	- plugins too
